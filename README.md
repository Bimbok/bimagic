## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

Run this one-line command to install Bimagic:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bimbok/bimagic/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bimbok/bimagic.git
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x bimagic/bimagic
```

3. Move it to your bin directory:
```bash
# Option 1: For user-local installation (no sudo required)
mkdir -p ~/bin
mv bimagic/bimagic ~/bin/

# Option 2: For system-wide installation (requires sudo)
sudo mv bimagic/bimagic /usr/local/bin/
```

4. Ensure the bin directory is in your PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if needed):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"  # For user-local installation
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up GitHub Credentials

Bimagic requires your GitHub username and a personal access token. Add these to your shell configuration file:

1. Open your shell configuration file:
```bash
# For bash users
nano ~/.bashrc

# For zsh users
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. Add these lines at the end of the file:
```bash
# GitHub credentials for bimagic
export GITHUB_USER="your_github_username"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
```

3. Reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "bimagic-cli")
4. Select the "repo" scope (this provides full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)

## Usage

Simply run the `bimagic` command in your terminal:

```bash
bimagic
```

You'll be presented with an interactive menu where you can choose from various Git operations.

### Menu Options

1. **Init new repo** - Initialize a new Git repository
2. **Add files** - Stage files for commit
3. **Commit changes** - Commit staged changes with a message
4. **Push to remote** - Push changes to GitHub (automatically sets remote if needed)
5. **Pull latest changes** - Fetch and merge changes from remote
6. **Create/switch branch** - Create a new branch or switch to an existing one
7. **Set remote** - Manually set the remote repository URL
8. **Show status** - Display the current repository status
9. **Remove files/folders (rm)** - Safely remove files and folders with git integration
10. **Exit** - Quit the wizard

### File Removal (Option 9)

The `rm` option provides a safe way to remove files and folders with full git integration:

#### Features:
- **Wildcard Support**: Use `*` to remove everything, or specific patterns like `*.txt`, `temp*`, etc.
- **Git Integration**: Automatically removes files from both git tracking and filesystem
- **Safety Checks**: Multiple confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects if you're in a git repository

#### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Remove all files (with extra confirmation)
*

# Remove all text files
*.txt

# Remove files starting with 'temp'
temp*

# Remove specific files
file1.txt folder1/
```

#### Safety Features:
- **Double confirmation** for `*` (everything) - requires typing "yes"
- **Preview** of what will be deleted before proceeding
- **Existence check** - only proceeds if files actually exist
- **Git-aware** - uses `git rm` for tracked files, regular `rm` for untracked files

#### How it works:
1. Enter the file pattern you want to remove
2. The tool shows you exactly what will be deleted
3. Confirm the deletion (y/N)
4. Files are removed from both git tracking and filesystem (if in a git repo)
5. Clear feedback about what was removed

## Why Sudo Might Be Required

### Understanding the Need for Elevated Privileges

The installation script may request sudo privileges for these reasons:

1. **System-wide installation**: 
   - The script tries to install to `/usr/local/bin/` by default
   - This directory is typically owned by root for security reasons
   - Writing to system directories requires administrative privileges

2. **Directory permissions**:
   - If you don't have a `~/bin` directory or it's not writable
   - The script falls back to system installation

### Avoiding Sudo Requirements

You can avoid needing sudo by:

1. Creating a local bin directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   ```

2. Ensuring it's in your PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. Running the installation again

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**:
   - Your GitHub token is stored in your shell configuration file
   - Protect this file with proper permissions (chmod 600)
   - Never share your token or commit it to version control

2. **Script Integrity**:
   - Review the installation script before running it
   - The script only copies files and sets permissions

3. **Network Security**:
   - The script uses HTTPS to communicate with GitHub
   - Ensure you're on a secure network when using the tool

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Command not found" after installation**
   - Your bin directory may not be in PATH
   - Add `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"` to your shell config file
   - Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - The script might not be executable
   - Run `chmod +x ~/bin/bimagic` or `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bimagic`

3. **GitHub authentication errors**
   - Verify your GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_TOKEN environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure your token has the necessary permissions

4. **Remote operation failures**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the repository name is correct

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that Git is installed: `git --version`
2. Verify your environment variables are set: `echo $GITHUB_USER`
3. Ensure you have a GitHub personal access token with repo permissions

## Uninstallation

If you ever need to remove Bimagic from your system, you have two options:

### Option 1: Curl Directly (Recommended)

Run the uninstall script directly from GitHub:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bimbok/bimagic/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Manual Uninstallation

1. Remove the Bimagic script:
   ```bash
   # Remove from user directory (if installed there)
   rm -f ~/bin/bimagic
   
   # Remove from system directory (if installed there - requires sudo)
   sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/bimagic
   ```

2. Optional: Remove GitHub credentials from your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   # Edit your shell config file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
   # Remove lines containing GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_TOKEN
   nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
   ```

### What the Uninstall Script Does

1. **Finds Installations**: Checks common installation directories (~/bin and /usr/local/bin)
2. **Confirmation**: Asks for confirmation before proceeding
3. **Removes Bimagic**: Deletes the script from all found locations
4. **Optional Cleanup**: Offers to remove GitHub environment variables from shell configuration files
5. **Creates Backups**: Creates timestamped backups of modified shell configuration files

### Safety Features

- Asks for confirmation before removing anything
- Creates backups of modified configuration files
- Uses sudo only when necessary (for system directories)
- Provides clear feedback about what's happening
- Includes timestamped backups to prevent data loss

### Notes

- The uninstall script will only remove the Bimagic script file
- Your Git repositories and other files will not be affected
- GitHub credentials are only removed if you explicitly choose to do so
- Backups are created before modifying any configuration files

Remember to update your repository with both the `uninstall.sh` script and the updated README section.
